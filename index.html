                <h2>Why Allegory?</h2>
                <p>Because insurance is not about punishment or discrimination but preventing and protecting. That’s why we never use your age, gender, credit score, where you live, or how many accidents you have had in the past to calculate your insurance premium. Our mission is clear: "Let’s rewrite the “allegory” of individualized insurance together!”</p>
